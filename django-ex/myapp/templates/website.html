Social housing in Queensland, Australia, is either provided by the government, or by non-profit organizations. This page provides the following information:
<p> <em>We still need to implement the feature that clicking on the navigation bar items opens a new webpage that then displays the following</em>
<p> ●	Characteristics of social housing in different Local Government Areas (LGA)
<P> ●	A geographic map of Queensland indicating the demand and supply of social housing per LGA
<p> ●	An indication of the mismatch between need and availability of different social housing sizes per number of bedrooms.

<p>

The data on social housing provides great insights into existing gaps of demand and supply of social housing.

<p>

The <u>key take aways</u> are <em>(not sure yet if we need that table here)</em>:
